Get a little too much eggnog last night?

00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,315

- Bad news?

Well, you know what cancels out bad news?
Good news.

- Today is the day that Wichita says...
- Adios.

Well, he should learn
to not get so attached.

174
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,837
Never get attached. Remember?
That was the problem with Columbus, he got too attached.

175
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:05,240
- Well, with Tallahassee, it's like he thinks he's my dad.
- Sure, but you are so lucky you don't have a boyfriend.

He ripped off the black man.

- There's something going on out there.
- What?

390
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,470
Berkeley told us about this new kind
of zombie that's stronger, and faster,

391

and deadlier and better adapted
to the hunt.

I mean, if you want us to come with you, just, like, ask us.

393
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,880
- Honestly, I just came back for guns and ammunition.
- Sure. Come on. Stop begging. We'll do it.

- She's not a kid anymore.

405
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,758
- Yeah, I'm terrible at notes.

- I doubt it. It's weird. What?

I'll say this about Murray, if I ever

- Attitude, the music...
- The hips, the ass.

Well, I was 10, but, you know, with Elvis,
there is something for everyone.

841
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:49,599
Cut to later, I'm in high school.
And my buddy Frankie Hammond says:

"Do your Elvis."

943
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:14,711
The world is your bathroom, meaning you can
just whip it out wherever you want,

944
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:15,760
and just have at it.

945
00:56:15,761 --> 00:56:19,391
Oh, just whip it out wherever you want!
That sounds a little uncouth.

946
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:23,673
The "whip it out" part's for guys, obviously.
If you're a woman, you can reveal it.

947
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,911
- Whichever.
- I have beware of bathrooms.

948
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,117
Yeah, I'm just generally careful
around them.

949
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,080
- We don't have to compare. It's not a competition.
- Doesn't have to be.

950
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,271
But number 18 is limber up.

951
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:36,192
- But that's...
- That's fine. I have warm up.

952
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:40,718
Again, not a competition,
but commandment number 45 for me is,

953
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:41,870
well, mind your manners.

954
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,720
Just because it's the apocalypse
doesn't mean you have to be rude.

955
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:47,634
Yeah, keep your hands to yourself, number 42.
Do you have sunscreen?

956
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:49,518
- Just shade.
- Shade. Of course.

957
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:52,479
It's free. It's everywhere.
Yeah. Number two, double tap.

958
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:55,997
- I have number five, confirm your kill.
- Confirm your kill.

959
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,959
- Avoid perishables. Do you have that?
- Sorry. Ziploc bags.

960
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,111
- Same thing, different word. Yeah.
- Yeah. Exactly.

961
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,317
I probably would shy away
from the word "Ziploc"

962
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,033
because I try
to avoid name brands.

963
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:08,113
Okay, great. So, what brought
you guys back so soon?

964
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:11,113
We was headed for the Rockies,
but the goddamn Bolts...

965
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:12,276
Bolts?

966
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:14,680
- <font color="#ff8000">ALBUQUERQUE:</font> Yeah.
- Yeah, the zombies out on the plains.

967
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,797
They're a lot tougher than
what we're used to.

968
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:21,909
I guess because of all the running and hunting.
So we call them Bolts, as in Usain.

969
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:25,391
- As in pretty fucking athletic.

- Yes. Literally my favourite movie. Well, <i>T2.</i>

972
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:33,439
- Yeah, <i>T2</i> is my second favourite movie.
- What's number one?

973
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:35,750
It's <i>Fantasia.</i>

974
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:42,075
Well, anyhow, the Bolts' food sources are running low,
so they're pushing east, which is <i>no bueno.</i>

975
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,152
You know what else is
<i>no bueno?</i>

976
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:46,992

00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:52,434
<font color="#ff8000">ALBUQUERQUE:</font> Yeah, well, let me call AAA
for you. I'm sure they'll be right over.

to play your cards as...

979

to cut off my circulation.

981
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:00,880

00:58:00,881 --> 00:58:05,557
- What'll you have, Florida?
- He strikes me as the lemon drop type.

983
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:08,519
You know, something with an umbrella
or something like that.

984
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:12,190
- I heard "something with an umbrella." Make it two.
- Three please. Three.

985
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,600
So that's your sidekick.

"Oh, he's a little slight, diminutive."

988

He may look a little bookish, but he's an animal too.

993
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:38,035

Come on, don't be so Gloria Glum.
I told you guys I was leaving.

1251
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,632
So, what,
you're just gonna split?

1252
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:30,835
It's time. Gotta set out
on my own adventures.

1255
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:38,434
So where are you gonna go?

1256
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:41,513
The direction's
the destination. West.

1257
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:45,554
West is that way.

1258
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,516
Yeah. Anyway, like the title of
a great Phil Collins song,

1259

Set Them Free."

- Pretty sure it was.

1261
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,996
- No, it was someone else.
- Pretty sure it was him.

1262
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:02,593
Yeah. Peace.

- Keep your tits dry.

1265
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:13,390
- Oh, okay.
- Didn't see that coming, right?

1266
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:14,880

I wouldn't not do.

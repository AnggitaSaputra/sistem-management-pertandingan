- Oh, Deuce.

677
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:13,010
- You look great.
- Thanks.

678
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:14,690
I want you
to meet my roommate.

679
00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:16,490
Who's there?
Kate?

680
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:19,890
- I hear someone.
- It's just me and my friend.

681
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:22,490
Are you sure?
I hear three people.

682
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:24,450
You're the third person.

683
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:26,410
Oh.
Oh, okay.

684
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:29,770
[Whispering] She's newly blind.
She's still getting adjusted.

685
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:33,130
Bergita, this is Deuce.

686
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:35,330
I think there's something
wrong with Cassie.

687
00:47:35,370 --> 00:47:37,770
Oh, honey.

688
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:39,530
This isn't Cassie.

689
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:41,530
Here she is.

690
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:43,450
[Meow]

691
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:45,610
Oh, there you are.

692
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:48,130
- It's nice to meet you.
- Hi.

693
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:54,370
Once you try it for the first time,
you're pretty happy with the results.

694
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:57,250
I've never met a hair transplant
technician before.

695
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:08,010
Oh, man, I forgot.
It's my dad's birthday.

696
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:10,410
- Let's go see him.
- He's working.

697
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:12,330
So?
What does he do?

698
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:17,290
He's in
the restaurant industry.

699
00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:22,850
Kate, I'd like you
to meet my dad, Bob Bigalow.

700
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:25,130
Bob, Kate.

701
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:27,050
Hi.

702
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:28,970
Son, I'm very proud of you.

703
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:31,850
She is
a lovely young lady.

704
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:34,250
[Chuckles]
Thank you.

705
00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:37,130
It's so nice to meet you.
Happy birthday.

706
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:39,690
- Thank you.
- Well, we should probably be going.

707
00:48:39,770 --> 00:48:42,010
Deuce.

708
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:44,810
Dad probably has a lot
of paperwork to do, and--

709
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:47,450
No, the paper's
completely stocked.

710
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:52,010
I've got plenty of time
to get acquainted with the woman
who's made my boy so happy.

711
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:54,490
We got you a cake.

712
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:56,410
Deuce said it's your favorite.

713
00:48:56,490 --> 00:49:00,170
- We had to go to
a Filipino bakery to get it.
- You didn't.

714
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:03,050
You did!

715
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:05,250
Raspberry bibingka.

716
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:07,170
Ah, you shouldn't have.

717
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:09,730
My wife,
God rest her soul,

718
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:11,850
use to make this
all the time.

719
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:13,770
You would've liked her.

720
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:15,690
Bangkok Betty.

721
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:20,930
She had the most amazing mouth.
It paid for our honeymoon.

722
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:23,930
We should probably
be going.

723
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:26,810
Deuce, it's your dad's birthday.

724
00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:33,410
Hi. Bob, we have an overflowing toilet
in the ladies' bathroom.

725
00:49:33,490 --> 00:49:36,330
There is shit everywhere.
It's a real mess.

726
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:40,170
- You think you could
take care of that for me?
- No worries, Vic. Right on it.

727
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:43,050
- I'd like you to meet
my son's girlfriend Kate.
- Kate, nice to meet you.

728
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:44,610
- You, too.
- Hi, Deuce.

729
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:46,970
So could you
get in there, Bob?

730
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:51,050
I got a party of ten coming in,
and I am up to my ankles in human crap.

731
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:53,250
It's a real stinkfest
back there.

732
00:49:53,330 --> 00:49:55,210
Sure.

733
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:57,770
Looks like I'd better
get back to work.

734
00:49:57,850 --> 00:50:00,290
It's a pleasure
meeting you, dear.

735
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:03,210
Warms my heart
Just being in your presence.

736
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,690
Thank you.

737
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:07,610
See you, son.

738
00:50:11,330 --> 00:50:15,090
See, my dad's one of those guys,
he likes to be involved
in every facet of the business.

739
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:18,970
- It's okay.
- No problem to small or big.
They come to him for everything.

740
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:21,770
Deuce, it's all right.

741
00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:26,490
It's not his restaurant.

742
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:29,450
My dad's not even a waiter.

743
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:32,810
He's the men's room attendant.
I'm sorry.

744
00:50:32,850 --> 00:50:35,210
Don't be silly.

745
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:38,650
You know
what my dad does?

746
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:40,970
He's an aeronautical
engineer.

[Water Sloshing]

748
00:50:51,730 --> 00:50:53,610

your candle?

752
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:13,690
Mmm, now that's
good bibingka.

753
00:51:21,850 --> 00:51:24,610
I had a really
nice time tonight.

754
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:27,130
I find that
hard to believe.

755
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:32,890
I've never met
anyone like you.

756
00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:35,450
Good.

757
00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:38,450
I have to see you
again.

758
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:44,050
When we go inside, try to be quiet
so we don't wake up Bergita.

% With you I'm not shy %

760
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:53,570

761

% My secrets to reveal %

% And I am steel %

Why don't I get
the light?

766
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:12,810
Hang on. I'll be right back.
Be right back.

You are good.

770
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:36,490
- Hi.
- Hi.

771
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:40,970
Are you all right?

772
00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:43,970
I need you to be
okay with something.

773
00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:46,410
What? I'm okay
with everything.

774
00:52:46,450 --> 00:52:48,450
Deuce.

775
00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:51,170
There may be things
about me that you don't like.

776
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:54,010
I like everything
about you.

777
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:57,970
I mean, physically.

778
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:01,330
So you're taller than me.
Big deal. I'll get over it.

779
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:03,890
It's not that.

780
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:05,810
What?

781
00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:09,410
If you were to find out
something about me...

782
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:12,450
and my body that was
maybe a little different...

783
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:14,930
than what you were used to,
would that be okay?

784
00:53:15,010 --> 00:53:18,890
There could be nothing
on your body that I wouldn't like.

785
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:20,930
What are you
talking about?

786
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:26,650
What do you got, like, six toes
or something? I can live with that.

787
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:28,930
Deuce, I have to tell you,

788
00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:31,210
- I have a--
- Shh.

[Gasps]
Oh, my God. I'm sorry!

791
00:54:04,970 --> 00:54:08,450
- I tried to tell you.
- No, it's my fault.

792
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:11,170
I shouldn't have
pulled it so hard.

793
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:13,170
If you want to leave,
I completely understand.

794
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:15,930
I don't want to leave.
I'm sorry I had that reaction.

795
00:54:16,010 --> 00:54:18,450
I just-- I got a lot of things
going on in my life recently,

796
00:54:18,530 --> 00:54:20,490
and they all sort of culminated
when your leg fell off--

797
00:54:20,570 --> 00:54:22,490
came off--
disconnected--

798
00:54:22,570 --> 00:54:25,130
- Just get out!
- Oh, my God!

799
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:26,970
Please leave.

800
00:54:29,410 --> 00:54:32,810
Kate!
I'm sorry!

801
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:35,050
[Sobbing]
Just go home.

802
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:37,370
Don't I have
a say in this?

803
00:54:37,450 --> 00:54:39,290
Hand me my leg.

804
00:54:39,370 --> 00:54:42,090
- Then will you come out and talk?
- I don't know.

[Click]

806
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:52,010
Are you sure
you want to stay?

807
00:54:52,090 --> 00:54:55,730
Yes, but only if
you come out of there.

808
00:54:56,970 --> 00:55:00,770
I need to know how you feel
about all this.

809
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:03,810
The same as I did
an hour ago,

810
00:55:03,850 --> 00:55:07,010
when I thought to myself,
"I'm the luckiest guy in the world...

811
00:55:07,090 --> 00:55:09,490
to be with her leg--
with you."

[Squeaking]

813
00:55:36,050 --> 00:55:38,810
Ow-w-w!

814
00:55:39,850 --> 00:55:42,490
Is this normal?
My face is numb.

815
00:55:42,570 --> 00:55:45,490
It's perfectly normal
in hair replacement surgery.

816
00:55:45,570 --> 00:55:48,570
The local anesthetic has numbed
the major nerves in your face,

817
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:50,530
Just like at the dentist.

818
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:53,970
-[Pounding]
- Ow-w-w-w!

819
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:58,370
You're Kate's best friends, and I know
your opinions mean a lot to her.

820
00:55:58,450 --> 00:56:02,050
And... I'd like to get
really serious with her.

821
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:04,970
- You're a prostitute!
- Not anymore.

822
00:56:05,010 --> 00:56:06,890
And it's "man-whore".

823
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:10,650
Anyway, I just quit.
I mean, Kate's the one for me.

824
00:56:10,730 --> 00:56:12,770
Listen, you were only supposed to
go out with her one night,

825
00:56:12,850 --> 00:56:14,970
show her a good time, and then
get the hell out of her life.

826
00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:17,890
- You know she's not normal.
- She's not like other girls.

827
00:56:17,930 --> 00:56:20,890
You know what her problem is?
Friends like you.

828
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:23,010
She's perfect.
She's kind,

829
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:26,610
she's sweet, she's funny,
and she likes me.

830
00:56:26,690 --> 00:56:28,690
Now I came here
to give you your money back--

831
00:56:28,770 --> 00:56:32,370
the money you paid a stranger
to have sex with your friend.

832
00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:37,730
Hey! You stay away
from her, man-whore!

833
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:41,330
Hiya, Deuce. Your three days
are up, lover boy.

- So where's Antoine's black book?
- I've looked everywhere.

835
00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:47,730
Listen, punk, you are aiding
and abetting a known criminal.

836
00:56:47,810 --> 00:56:50,050
Do the initials T and J mean
anything to you?

837
00:56:50,090 --> 00:56:52,450
Uh, turkey jizz?
I don't--

838
00:56:52,490 --> 00:56:57,010
You better show some respect, or I'm
gonna rip that pleasure-giving
tongue out of your head!

- [Zipper Unzips]
- One more thing.
